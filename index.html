                  <p>
                    At FundGuard we build a cloud-based enterprise operating platform for asset
                    managers, asset owners, custodian banks and fund administrators to manage
                    investments across mutual funds and ETFs, alternatives, insurance, and pension.
                    As a Principal engineer and one of the first employees I play a major role in
                    the design and implementation of this high scale, big data cloud based system.
                    My work spans on almost all aspects of the system i.e. the build system,
                    automation, infrastructure, AI model design, train and predication, fin-tech logic,
                    security, performance and system durability. I share my experience and knowledge of
                    the system with other team members and empower them to create high quality code and product.
                    <br/>
                    I am very proud to be part and a first member of a growing software company (startup) with
                    a huge potential to disrupt a conservative industry. I draw passion and motivation knowing
                    that the product I help to design and build is making a real change in the world.

                  <p>
                    At VMware i was involoved with the design and development of several solutions:
                    <ul>

                        is a solution for application delivery, backup and management over the cloud.
                        The services ran over Google Cloud utilizing advanced technologies such as
                        Docker containers and Kubernetes.
                        We applied a micro-service pattern to support large scale demands. As senior
                        software engineer I lead the design and development of key features, I
                        co-ordinated with teams abroad, product owners and architects. I performed
                        hands-on POCs for new technologies, frameworks and product integrations.

                        and physical machines in the hybrid cloud, based on an agent-server
                        architecture. I wrote high and low level design documents, implemented complex
                        features, created PoC for innovating new features, solved major bugs and gave
                        internal tech-talks to share information and grow the team. I played a major
                        role in designing the product's build and automation systems.

                    The rating scores can then be used by a CRM application to identify highest ranked company
                    profiles in response to a user input. The highest ranked company profiles are displayed for
                    selection, and when a user selects one of the profiles, fields of a CRM record being created
                    via the CRM application are auto-filled with information from the selected one of the company
                    profiles to auto populate the new CRM record with the data for the selected company profile.</p>

                    company names from websites based on HTML extracted from home webpages of different companies.
                    An HTML source file is downloaded from a home webpage of a company, and many candidate company
                    names are extracted from the HTML source file along with support indicators that are used
                    as support for determining the company names. Each support indicator is an extracted name that
                    has been determined to have similarities to the company name extracted from the home webpage
                    of each company. A clustering algorithm clusters similar company names and supporters together
                    into different clusters. A score is computed for each cluster using a heuristic formula, and a
                    cluster having the highest score is selected. Selection rules are then applied to select a top
                    ranked name from each of the selected clusters as a company name.</p>

                     be automatically clustered into different clusters that each represent a particular
                     company. A particular value for each attribute of each cluster that is determined to
                     have the highest score can then be selected for inclusion in a corresponding company
                     profile for that cluster.</p>

                  <p>Me and two frieds joined a three days hackathon, just for fun. The mission was to build an end-to-end
                     solution for the "Internet of Things" using Texas Instrument's CC3200 board and IBM's bluemix cloud.
                     We have designed and build a fitness engagement and tracking device based on motion detection.
                     During the hackton days we encountered many problems and we had to work as a team to apply creative
                     solutions to overcome them. The effort paid off- by the end of the three days hackaton we were chosen
                     to be one of the four finalists to present in the E&Y Journey's conference in which we were selected
                     by the judges from EY, Pitango, TI and IBM to win the first place.</p>

                      has joined VMware as a junior developer until he become a senior software
                      engineer! Hanan is super smart, fast as a bullet and understands technology.
                      He can program in any language out there, do it in the IDE, write complicated
                      system scripts, or design complicated integration with 3rd parties or
                      development tools.<br/><br/>
                      Hanan was the focal point and the technology leader in all the teams he has
                      been part of. He had tremendous impact on his teams, on the broader group and
                      on VMware in general. This came to reality by his innovative thinking and his
                      passion to making advanced technology fit to customer needs.<br/><br/>
                      It was a pleasure managing Hanan - I would hire back in a second and I highly
                      recommend him to each company that he is seeking for the best people!</p>

                    <p>I have recruited Hanan fresh out of university around four years ago, and
                      right at the beginning it was obvious that heâ€™s a stellar developer. Smart,
                      dedicated, and with an amazing ability to master quickly new technologies and
                      internalize them.<br/><br/>
                      In the last 8 months Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with Hanan again as a Sr.
                      developer in my team. In the few years that passed, Hanan has advanced his
                      career significantly, becoming a key technical leader in his group, and when
                      he rejoined my team it was evident that he can take significant
                      responsibilities and carry them to completion.<br/><br/>
                      Hanan led and played a key role in a project to convert an on-prem product to
                      a SaaS offering. He designed and developed the CI/CD process and was a natural
                      choice to lead deeply technical tasks.
                      Iâ€™m continuously impressed by Hananâ€™s ability to present a topic in a clear,
                      deep and organized manner and to lead a technical discussion around the
                      decisions we need to take.<br/><br/>
                      Hanan is an invaluable asset to my team and any other team that will be
                      privileged to work with him</p>

                    <p>I have managed Hanan in the last 9 months. Simply: If you are looking for the
                      best people to build your dream team, Hanan should be your first
                      hire.<br/><br/>
                      In my team, Hanan was in charge to design and build our cloud platform from
                      scratch, including convert an on-prem application to micro-services
                      architecture, running on Google and AWS, design and implement the CI/CD
                      process and making sure all scale and performance aspects are met. He led
                      these efforts, become master in cloud technologies, implemented the code,
                      educateed the team and delivered everything on time and in very high
                      quality.<br/><br/>
                      He is very talented engineer, equipped with huge technological and technical
                      knowledge, super fast learning abilities and high motivation. His ability to
                      quickly gain knowledge and master any technology is remarkable.<br/><br/>
                      I would definitely recommend Hanan for any Sr. Developer position and would
                      hire him again in an instant.</p>

                      for almost 3 years at Salesforce. <br/><br/>
                      Hanan has an amazing approach to architecting
                      and developing complex, large-scale software systems. His innovative nature
                      brought both new technologies and techniques to our projects, running at large-scale

                    <p>I have known Hanan since 2009, when we were both studying towards our computer
                      science bachelor degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Our curriculum
                      was pretty much the same and we have worked together on many theoretical
                      and practical assignments in computer science. <br/><br/>
                      A few years after graduation,
                      we had the chance to work again together at Salesforce, first as peers and
                      later on as team members where I got to manage Hanan. Hanan was a key player
                      on my team, he led the design and architecture of the system we were building
                      and introduced new technologies to make it more stable and scalable.<br/><br/>
                      In the past few months, when I was on paternity leave, Hanan took my responsibilities
                      as and led the team. Hanan did a great job and managed to have the team accomplish
                      many goals, he coordinated with peer teams and higher management to have the
                      product ready in time. Moreover, Hanan took full responsibility on patenting
                      our work to the point when we have today seven patents ready to be submitted
                      for review.<br/><br/>
                      Hanan is a smart, experienced, hard worker engineer and I would hire him back in a second</p>
